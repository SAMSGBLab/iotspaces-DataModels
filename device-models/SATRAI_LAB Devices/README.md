# SATRAI Lab Device Instances
This repository contains instances of specific devices using the NGSI-LD data models for smart devices, their observations, and actuations. These devices are part of the SATRAI Lab at Télécom SudParis, where they are used for research and development purposes.

## Overview
The SATRAI Lab at Télécom SudParis is equipped with a variety of IoT devices, sensors, and actuators, which are modeled using the provided NGSI-LD data models. These instances demonstrate how the data models can be applied to real devices and help developers create portable applications that utilize high-level observations instead of specific device properties.

In this repository, you can find instances of the following devices:

Smart Light Bulb
Smart Thermostat

Additional devices as the appropriate models are included

Each instance includes the device's specific attributes, along with the associated observations and actuations.
