# ngsi-ld Data Models

This repository contains data models in the [NGSI-LD](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/CIM/001_099/009/01.01.01_60/gs_CIM009v010101p.pdf) format for smart domains such as smart buildings and smart transportation. These models are still in the experimental phase and are being used for testing and evaluation.

The goal of this repository is to provide a standardized and flexible way to represent entities and their properties in these smart domains, making it easy for developers to exchange and process data between systems. 

The models are available for public use, and developers are welcome to use and experiment with them. The repository contains the following models:
* **Smart Buildings**: A model for representing entities such as rooms, buildings, etc..
* **Smart Transportation**: A model for representing entities such as buses, and real time transit information.

## How to use

To use the models in this repository, you can simply download them and import them into your application or since the models are in ngsi-ld format, you can reference the appropriate context file.

Please note that these models are still in the experimental phase and may be subject to change. We welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement.
