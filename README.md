## General Info
This is a public repo where the ngsi-ld data models are presented and published in order to be available for public usage. Please keep in mind that every data model is experimental and should not be used as a standard.

### Latest Changes
- Fixed a lot of typos and missing schemas
- Renamed model folder to more appropriate and fixed context link

### TODO
- Revalidate that the context file and models work by using the context broker.

### Original Readme 

-***Note*** the previous ReadMe is added below, as a means to keep track where the original building data model type_definitions.json was hosted, this has been migrated in order to be hosted on this gitlab.   

The prefix "https://pastebin.com/raw/Q5F1Zb7Y#" in the `context.json` and `types.yaml` file contains the contents of `type-definitions.json`. Hosting that file on GitLab is a bit of a pickle and so it is still in a pastebin.
