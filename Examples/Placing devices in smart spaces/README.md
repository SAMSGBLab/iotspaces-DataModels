# Instantiating Smart Devices and Placing Them in Smart Spaces
This repository contains the entity instances for smart devices as presented in the accompanying tutorial. The tutorial guides you through the process of instantiating smart devices, placing them in smart spaces, and creating models for these devices if they don't already exist.

ðŸ“š Tutorial: Instantiating Smart Devices and Placing Them in Smart Spaces

## Overview
In the tutorial, you will find examples of various types of smart devices, such as Smart Light Bulbs, Smart Thermostats, etc., and how they can be instantiated and placed in smart spaces like Smart Homes and Smart Buildings.

This GitHub repository provides the full entity instances corresponding to the examples given in the tutorial. Feel free to download and use them as a starting point for your own smart device projects.

## Entity Instances
The following entity instances are available in this repository:

Smart Light Bulb (e.g., Philips Hue Smart Lamp)
Smart Thermostat (e.g., Nest Learning Thermostat)
More instances will be added if the tutorial expands.

For a detailed explanation on how to work with these entity instances and create your own, refer to the tutorial linked above.
